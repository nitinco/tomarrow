      <h2>What is computer ?</h2>
      <p>A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. 
        You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to 
        edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.</p>
        <h2>Types of computer</h2>
        <p>There are 4 types:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Supercomputer:</li>
          <p>Supercomputers are one of the fastest computers in the world. These computers are costly and are only employed for specialized applications that require a large number of mathematical calculations or number crunching.

            For example, supercomputers' tasks are animated graphics, scientific simulations, weather forecasting, geological data analysis in industries like petrochemical prospecting, fluid dynamic calculations, nuclear energy research, and electronic design.
            
            It is exciting to note that supercomputers can process trillions of instructions in a single second! This is mainly because these devices have thousands of interconnected processors. Also, the first supercomputer was developed in 1976 by Roger Cray.</p>
          <li>Minicomputer:</li>
          <p>A minicomputer is a midsize, multi-processing system. Minicomputers are capable of supporting up to 250 users at the same time. Usually, these devices have two or more processors.

            It is common for minicomputers to be employed in institutes and departments related to accounting, inventory management, and billing. Some experts also believe that minicomputers lie somewhere between a microcomputer and a mainframe because minicomputers are smaller than a mainframe but more extensive than a microcomputer.
            
            Minicomputers are lighter in weight. These devices can easily fit anywhere and are portable. These devices are less expensive and very fast compared to their size. Minicomputers tend to remain charged for long intervals and can function in an environment without controlled operations.
            
            You might also want to learn that minicomputers are primarily used to perform three functions. These three functions are mentioned below.</p>
          <li>Workstation:</li>
          <p>A workstation is a computer that is used explicitly for engineering applications like CAD/CAM. Workstations can also be used for software development, desktop publishing, and developing other types of applications. All of these tasks require a moderate amount of computing power and relatively high-quality graphics capabilities.

            In most cases, workstations come equipped with large amounts of RAM, inbuilt network support, a graphic user interface, and a high-resolution graphics screen. Many workstations also have mass storage devices like disk drives. However, it should be noted here that diskless workstations are a type of workstation that comes without any disk drive.</p>
          <li>Pc(Personal computer):</li>  
          <p>A Personal computer or PC can be described as a small and somewhat inexpensive computer that has been specifically designed for individual use. These devices are based on microprocessor technology, enabling manufacturers to put an entire CPU on a single chip.

            These days many organizations use personal computers for completing tasks related to desktop publishing, accounting, word processing, database management, and running spreadsheets. People also use personal computers at home for surfing the internet and playing games.
            
            It is important to note that even though personal computers were developed to work as a single-user system, they are still linked together to form a network. If we talk about power, then Macintosh and PC's high-end models offer about the same computing power and graphic capabilities as low-end workstations by Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and Sun Microsystems.</p>    
        </ol>
        <h2>Input/Output devices</h2>
        <p>An input/output device, often known as an IO device, is any hardware that allows a human operator or other systems to interface with a computer. 
          Input/output devices, as the name implies, are capable of delivering data (output) to and receiving data from a computer (input).
          An input/output (I/O) device is a piece of hardware that can take, output, or process data.
          It receives data as input and provides it to a computer, as well as sends computer data to storage media as a storage output.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Input devices</li>
       
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Keyboard:</li>
          <p>Keyboard is the most common and very popular input device which helps to input data to the computer. The layout of the keyboard is like that of traditional typewriter, although there are some additional keys provided for performing additional functions.
            Keyboards are of two sizes 84 keys or 101/102 keys, but now keyboards with 104 keys or 108 keys are also available for Windows and Internet.
          </p>
          <li>Mouse:</li>
          <p>Mouse is the most popular pointing device. It is a very famous cursor-control device having a small palm size box with a round ball at its base, which senses the movement of the mouse and sends corresponding signals to the CPU when the mouse buttons are pressed.

            Generally, it has two buttons called the left and the right button and a wheel is present between the buttons. A mouse can be used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, but it cannot be used to enter text into the computer.</p>
          <li>Joystick:</li>
          <p>Joystick is also a pointing device, which is used to move the cursor position on a monitor screen. It is a stick having a spherical ball at its both lower and upper ends. The lower spherical ball moves in a socket. The joystick can be moved in all four directions.
            The function of the joystick is similar to that of a mouse. It is mainly used in Computer Aided Designing (CAD) and playing computer games.
          </p>
          <li>LightPen:</li>
          <p>Light pen is a pointing device similar to a pen. It is used to select a displayed menu item or draw pictures on the monitor screen. It consists of a photocell and an optical system placed in a small tube.
            When the tip of a light pen is moved over the monitor screen and the pen button is pressed, its photocell sensing element detects the screen location and sends the corresponding signal to the CPU.
          </p>
          <li>Microphone:</li>
          <p>Microphone is an input device to input sound that is then stored in a digital form.The microphone is used for various applications such as adding sound to a multimedia presentation or for mixing music.</p>
        </ol>
        <li>Output devices</li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>monitor:</li>
          <p>A computers principal output device is a monitor, often known as a Visual Display Unit (VDU). It displays the processed data like text, images, videos, audios, etc. It makes images by arranging microscopic dots in a rectangular pattern, known as pixels. The sharpness of an image is determined by the number of pixels. There are two types of monitor viewing screens: </p>
          <li>printer:</li>
          <p>A printer is an externally connected peripheral device that is used to provide a hard-copy output to the user. When a command is given to the computer, the processor reciprocates it and finally, the result is obtained in the form of a printed document that is physically accessible.</p>
          <li>Speaker/Headphones:</li>
          <p>Speakers transform the electrical signal into vibrations. These vibrations, when pressed against the speaker’s diaphragm, produce sound. Also, speakers consist of a series of amplifiers that resonate at different frequencies, providing a significant strength to the signal, which is why a loud sound is heard. Likewise, in headphones, the electrical current running through the headphone wire gets linked to the permanent magnet present inside the bud. As a result, the air is pushed against its diaphragm. Therefore, the sound is produced.</p>
          <li>projector:</li>
          <p>The projector, as the name suggests, projects the data on a big surface or screen. A projector is a visual device that makes use of a technique under which light is flashed through a lens and enlarged impressions are created on the screen. However, modern projectors employ laser beams to generate pictures.

          </p>
          
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <h2>What is software ?</h2>
      <p>Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate a computer and execute specific tasks. In simpler terms, software tells a computer how to function. It’s a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts, and programs that run on devices such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets, and other smart devices. Software contrasts with hardware, which is the physical aspects of a computer that perform the work.

        Without software, most computers would be useless. For example, a web browser is a software application that allows users to access the internet. Without the web browser software, reading this page on Webopedia wouldn’t be possible. An operating system (OS) is a software program that serves as the interface between other applications and the hardware on a computer or mobile device. TCP/IP is built into all major operating systems to allow computers to communicate over long distance networks. Without the OS or the protocols built into it, it wouldn’t be possible to access a web browser.</p>
      <h2>Types of software</h2>
      <p>There are 2 types:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Application software:</li>
        <p>This is everything else! Anything that is not an operating system or a utility is an application or app. So a word processor, spreadsheet, web browser, and graphics software are all examples of application software, and they can do many specific tasks.

          You can remove and add applications on your computer using the operating system.
          
          Application software like a word processor regularly directs the operating system to load and save files from and to the hard drive. When you are working on a file, it is saved temporarily in the RAM. It is only when you choose to save it that it is written to the hard drive.
          
          This is why, if the computer crashes while you’re working on a file, you may lose any changes you didn’t save. Data stored in the RAM is volatile. The data is lost when the RAM loses power.</p>
        <li>system software:</li>
        <p>If you think of software as being in layers, the system software is the bottom layer: it sits between the hardware and the application software.

          Operating systems like Windows, macOS, Android and iOS are examples of system software. Operating systems are loaded into RAM when the device starts up, and have access to the hard drive.</p>
      </ol>
