        <h2 id="one">What is software testing ?</h2>
        <p>Software testing can be stated as the process of verifying and validating whether a software or application is bug-free, meets the technical requirements as guided by its design and development, and meets the user requirements effectively and efficiently by handling all the exceptional and boundary cases. 
            The process of software testing aims not only at finding faults in the existing software but also at finding measures to improve the software in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and usability. It mainly aims at measuring the specification, functionality, and performance of a software program or application. 
        </p>
        <h2 id="two">Why software testing is important?</h2>
        <p>Few can argue against the need for quality control when developing software. Late delivery or software defects can damage a brand’s reputation — leading to frustrated and lost customers. In extreme cases, a bug or defect can degrade interconnected systems or cause serious malfunctions.

            Consider Nissan having to recall over 1 million cars due to a software defect in the airbag sensor detectors. Or a software bug that caused the failure of a USD 1.2 billion military satellite launch. 2  The numbers speak for themselves. Software failures in the US cost the economy USD 1.1 trillion in assets in 2016. What’s more, they impacted 4.4 billion customers. </p>
            <h2 id="three">What are the benefits of Software Testing?</h2>
            <p>Here are the benefits of using software testing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost-effective:</li>
                <p> It is one of the important advantages of software testing. Testing any IT project on time helps you to save your money for the long term. In case if the bugs caught in the earlier stage of software testing, it costs less to fix.</p>
                <li>Security:</li>
                <p>It is the most vulnerable and sensitive benefit of software testing. People are looking for trusted products. It helps in removing risks and problems earlier.</p>
                <li>Product:</li>
                <p>It is an essential requirement of any software product. Testing ensures a quality product is delivered to customers.</p>
                <li>customer satisfaction:</li>
                <p> The main aim of any product is to give satisfaction to their customers. UI/UX Testing ensures the best user experience.</p>
            </ul>
            
        <h2 id="four">Types of software test</h2>
       <p>there are 4 types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Unit testing</li>
            <p>Unit Testing It is a type of software testing in which a small piece of code is tested to see if the code works as expected. The name is derived from the fact that tests are done on a unit by unit basis. The goal of Unit testing is to help reduce the cost of bug fixes, as this way, bugs or errors in the code level are identified early in the development lifecycle. The cost of fixing bugs rises exponentially.</p>
            <li>Integration testing</li>
            <p>ntegration testing, as its name implies, verifies that the interface between two software units or modules works correctly. It is a broader type of testing that covers connection between 2 or more moduled and can also in some cases, cover the whole application.

                In the end-to-end process of software testing, Integration Testing will be performed after the Unit Testing and before System Testing.</p>
                <li>System testing</li>
                <p>System Testing is a level of testing that validates the complete and fully integrated software product. The purpose of a system test is to evaluate the end-to-end system specifications. Usually, the software is only one element of a larger computer-based system. Ultimately, the software is interfaced with other software/hardware systems. System Testing is actually a series of different tests whose sole purpose is to exercise the full computer-based system.</p>
                <li>Acceptance testing</li>
                <p>Once the System Testing process is completed by the testing team and is signed-off, the entire Product/application is handed over to the customer/few users of customers/both, to test for its acceptability i.e., Product/application should be flawless in meeting both the critical and major Business requirements. Also, end-to-end business flows are verified similar to in a real-time scenarios.

                    The production-like environment will be the testing environment for Accepting Testing (Usually termed as Staging, Pre-Prod, Fail-Over, UAT environment).
                    This is a black-box testing technique where only the functionality is verified to ensure that the product meets the specified acceptance criteria (no need for design/implementation knowledge).</p>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="five">Software testing techniques</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stress testing</li>
            <p>Stress testing is the process of determining the ability of a computer, network, program or device to maintain a certain level of effectiveness under unfavorable conditions. The process can involve quantitative tests done in a lab, such as measuring the frequency of errors or system crashes.</p>
            <li>White box testing</li>
            <p>White Box Testing is software testing technique in which internal structure, design and coding of software are tested to verify flow of input-output and to improve design, usability and security. In white box testing, code is visible to testers so it is also called Clear box testing, Open box testing, Transparent box testing, Code-based testing and Glass box testing.

                It is one of two parts of the Box Testing approach to software testing. Its counterpart, Blackbox testing, involves testing from an external or end-user type perspective. On the other hand, White box testing in software engineering is based on the inner workings of an application and revolves around internal testing.</p>
            <li>black box Testing</li>
            <p>Black box testing involves testing a system with no prior knowledge of its internal workings. A tester provides an input, and observes the output generated by the system under test. This makes it possible to identify how the system responds to expected and unexpected user actions, its response time, usability issues and reliability issues.

                Black box testing is a powerful testing technique because it exercises a system end-to-end. </p>
            <li>Security testing</li>
            <p>Security Testing is a type of Software Testing that uncovers vulnerabilities, threats, risks in a software application and prevents malicious attacks from intruders. The purpose of Security Tests is to identify all possible loopholes and weaknesses of the software system which might result in a loss of information, revenue, repute at the hands of the employees or outsiders of the Organization.</p>
            <li>performance testing</li>
            <p>Performance testing is a testing measure that evaluates the speed, responsiveness and stability of a computer, network, software program or device under a workload. Organizations will run performance tests in order to identify performance-related bottlenecks.</p>
            <li>Regression testing</li>
            <p>Regression testing is a software testing practice that ensures an application still functions as expected after any code changes, updates, or improvements. Regression testing is responsible for the overall stability and functionality of the existing features.</p>
            <li>Alpha testing</li>
            <p>Alpha testing is the initial phase of validating whether a new product will perform as expected. Alpha tests are carried out early in the development process by internal staff and are followed up with beta tests, in which a sampling of the intended audience actually tries the product out.</p>
            <li>Beta testing</li>
            <p>In software development, a beta test is the second phase of software testing in which a sampling of the intended audience tries the product out. Beta is the second letter of the Greek alphabet. Originally, the term alpha test meant the first phase of testing in a software development process.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="six">What is test case?</h2>
        <p>A test case is a set of conditions for evaluating a particular feature of a software product to determine its compliance with the business requirements.
            A test case has pre-requisites, input values, and expected results in a documented form that cover the different test scenarios.
            Once the test cases are created from the requirements, it is the job of the testers to execute those test cases. The testers read all the details in the test case, perform the test steps, and then based on the expected and actual result, mark the test case as Pass or Fail.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to write and execute test cases?</li>
            <p>Writing test cases varies depending on what the test case is measuring or testing. This is also a situation where sharing test assets across dev and test teams can accelerate software testing. But it all starts with knowing how to write a test case effectively and efficiently.
                Test cases have a few integral parts that should always be present in fields. However, every test case can be broken down into 8 basic steps.
                <br><br> Step 1: Test Case ID
                <br><br>Step 2: Test Description
                <br><br>Step 3: Assumptions and Pre-Conditions
                <br><br>Step 4: Test Data
                <br><br>Step 5: Steps to be Executed
                <br><br>Step 6: Expected Result
                <br><br>Step 7: Actual Result and Post-Conditions
                <br><br>Step 8: Pass/Fail
                </p>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="seven"> What is quality assurance?</h2>
        <p>Quality Assurance (QA) in software testing is defined as a procedure to ensure the quality of a product or service meeting the specifications set by the organization. QA enhances the software development process and makes it efficient and effective as per quality standards defined for software products. Quality Assurance is also called Quality Assurance Testing.
            <br><br>Importance of Quality Assurance
            <ul class="sss">
                <li>Make quality assurance an inherent part of the technical team.</li>
                <li>Create a robust testing environment</li>
                <li>Predefined quality standards</li>
                <li>Select the release criteria carefully.</li>
                <li>Measure quality metrics</li>
                <li>Create a performance testing and dedicated security team.</li>
                <li>Allocate appropriate time for each process</li>
                <li>Prioritize the bug fixes based on software usage</li>
                <li>Leverage automation tools whenever needed.</li>
                <li>Maintain continuous communication, collaboration, and optimization across all departments.</li>
                 </ul>
